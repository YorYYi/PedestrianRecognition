### Description
PedestrianRecognition is a software that obstains and evaluates models that solve the task of recognition of crossing action through self-supervised learning techniques. The self-supervised methods implemented are:
- __Temporal order verification__: verify whether a sequence of input frames is in correct temporal order.
